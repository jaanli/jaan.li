Here are some of my favorite longform adaptations:

* _Tiger King_ began as a Texas Monthly [article](https://www.texasmonthly.com/true-crime/joe-exotic-a-dark-journey-into-the-world-of-a-man-gone-wild/)
* _The Fast and Furious_ franchise began as a Vibe [article](https://www.vibe.com/features/editorial/racer-x-rafael-estevez-kenneth-li-fast-and-furious-inspiration-may-1998-336369/)
* _Nomadland (2020)_ began as a Harper's [article](https://harpers.org/archive/2014/08/the-end-of-retirement/)
* _Nice White Parents_ began as this longform podcast called [Three Miles](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/550/three-miles)
* _Blue Crush_ began as this Susan Orlean-reported [article](https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/water-activities/lifes-swell/)

Predictions of which longform articles will be adapted into TV shows or films:
