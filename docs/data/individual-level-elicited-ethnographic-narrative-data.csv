year,location,description
1950,LA,Spent a year in Los Angeles trying to make it big in Dollywood. Ultimately failed miserably.
1951,LosAltos,Moved up to Los Altos to decompose and find myself. Ended up just getting lost in the smog.
1952,Dallas,Decided to settle down in Dallas and open a chain of dry cleaning stores. Business was pressed for time from the start.
1953,NYC,Took a bite out of the Big Apple. Turns out I'm allergic to large crowds and overpriced hot dogs.
1954,Princeton,Escaped to the hallowed ivory towers of Princeton in hopes of becoming an esteemed academic. Quickly realized I don't have the aptitude or the ivy league pedigree.
1955,LA,Back in LA trying to pedal my screenplay. Hollywood said they already have one too many struggling writers.
1956,LosAltos,Gave Silicon Valley a shot as a techpreneur. My startup collapsed faster than a house of cords.
1957,Dallas,Yeehaw - back in Dallas! Tried to resurrect my dry cleaning empire. Was hung out to dry by the competition.
1958,NYC,Another stint in NYC - this time as a "mover and shaker". The only thing I moved was my bowels (all that street meat).
1959,Princeton,Crawled back to Princeton to lick my wounds and audit some classes. Felt very audacious indeed.
1960,LA,Third time's the charm they say. Not for me and LA though.
