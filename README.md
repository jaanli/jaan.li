# jaan.li

Created using:

```
yarn create @observablehq
```

This is an [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework) project. To start the local preview server, run:

```
yarn dev
```


Then visit <http://localhost:3000> to preview your project.

## Project structure

A typical Framework project looks like this:

```ini
.
├─ docs
│  ├─ components
│  │  └─ timeline.js           # an importable module
│  ├─ data
│  │  ├─ launches.csv.js       # a data loader
│  │  └─ events.json           # a static data file
│  ├─ example-dashboard.md     # a page
│  ├─ example-report.md        # another page
│  └─ index.md                 # the home page
├─ .gitignore
├─ observablehq.config.js      # the project config file
├─ package.json
└─ README.md
```

**`docs`** - This is the “source root” — where your source files live. Pages go here. Each page is a Markdown file. Observable Framework uses [file-based routing](https://observablehq.com/framework/routing), which means that the name of the file controls where the page is served. You can create as many pages as you like. Use folders to organize your pages.

**`docs/index.md`** - This is the home page for your site. You can have as many additional pages as you’d like, but you should always have a home page, too.

**`docs/data`** - You can put [data loaders](https://observablehq.com/framework/loaders) or static data files anywhere in your source root, but we recommend putting them here.

**`docs/components`** - You can put shared [JavaScript modules](https://observablehq.com/framework/javascript/imports) anywhere in your source root, but we recommend putting them here. This helps you pull code out of Markdown files and into JavaScript modules, making it easier to reuse code across pages, write tests and run linters, and even share code with vanilla web applications.

**`observablehq.config.js`** - This is the [project configuration](https://observablehq.com/framework/config) file, such as the pages and sections in the sidebar navigation, and the project’s title.

## Working with secrets and API keys

* Go to repository settings: https://github.com/jaanli/jaan.li/settings/secrets/actions 
* Click add secret
* Make sure the YAML configuration for the GitHub Actions deploy script is set up to use the secret

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

* Comment out the Cloudflare secrets in the deploy script

## Using with Cloudflare Pages

Create a Cloudflare API Token: https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens with edit permissions for: `Account.Cloudflare Pages`.

Then add the following secrets to the repository secrets: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and make sure they are referenced correctly in the YAML configuration for the GitHub Actions deploy script.
